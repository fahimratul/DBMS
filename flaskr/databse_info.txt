-> sensitive data (password), is stored as hash
-> enables us to create multiple running instances
    and launch multiple version of same app
-> makes unit testing easy

    according to role of each script providing
    modularity
-> makes the app installable //yet to implement
-> uses proper wsgi server and protected from
    most ddos attacks. //yet to implement
-> in one sentence: makes the app prodction

## 🔍 **METHODS TO VIEW ALL CHANGES**

### **1. GIT DIFF COMPARISON**

Since you're on the "Tamim" branch, you can see all changes compared to main branch:

```bash
# See all file changes
git status

# See detailed changes in all files
git diff main

# See changes in specific files
git diff main rapid/recipient.py
git diff main rapid/static/script/recipient.js

# See a summary of what files changed
git diff --name-only main

# See number of lines added/removed per file
git diff --stat main
```

### **2. SPECIFIC FILE COMPARISONS**

View exactly what changed in each key file:

```bash
# Backend changes
git diff main rapid/recipient.py

# Frontend changes
git diff main rapid/static/script/recipient.js

# Template changes (if any)
git diff main rapid/templates/recipient/recipient.html

# Database schema changes (if any)
git diff main rapid/schema.sql
```

### **3. COMMIT HISTORY**

See all commits you've made:

```bash
# View all commits on current branch
git log --oneline

# View commits that differ from main
git log main..HEAD --oneline

# Detailed view of each commit
git log --graph --pretty=format:'%h - %an, %ar : %s'
```

### **4. GENERATE PATCH FILES**

Create patch files for all your changes:

```bash
# Create a single patch file with all changes
git diff main > all_changes.patch

# Create individual patch files for each file
git diff main rapid/recipient.py > backend_changes.patch
git diff main rapid/static/script/recipient.js > frontend_changes.patch
```
